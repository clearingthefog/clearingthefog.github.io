<!-- # Clearing the Fog (of WAR) -->

Welcome! I created this site because I was curious to answer a couple of questions, including: How uncertain is WAR? Who has the best statistical case for MVP? By how much do different WAR implementations differ, and why? If you've ever wondered the same things, you're in the right place!

- Start at the [What Is WAR](/pages/what_is_war.html) tab if you're new here
- Check out the [Player Comparison](/pages/player_comparisons.html) tool to dive into the components of WAR and compare specific players
- Take a look at the [Leaderboards](/pages/generated/figures_standalone/war_leaders/AL.html) to get a sense of the statistical leaders

If you fancy yourself a sabermatrician, check out the [Details](/pages/details.html) tab for the more technical aspects.
